You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

You can write your posts using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a simple but powerful markup.

Feel free to modify the site, add pages, change and change things around.

Keep an eye on the [Appsterdam Embassy Page repo](https://github.com/Appsterdam/embassy-page) for updates, changes and improvements.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
